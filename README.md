This is a single page application with the purpose of integrating third-party server-side API so that requests can be made for data to be retrieved and presented for our use.

By using [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) as a source, we can utilize the data in conjunction with `local storage` data to present a weather dashboard for our user.


## Usage

This application is intended to create a weather dashboard for a traveler; so that they can see the weather outlook for multiple cities across a 5 day forecast.

After they search for a city, they are presented with current and future weather conditions in that city and the city is added to the search history so that they can review as needed. 

The city name, date, icon of weather condition, temperature, humidity, and wind speed are visible. In addition they can see the 5-day forecast that displays the date, weather condition icon, temperature, wind speed, and humidity.
